Porting Notes
========================================

* Use float64 for Float
* Use int for Int
* Use enum pattern for Haxe enumerations
* Keep to name conventions but minor corrections are ok (Settings instead of Setting for example)
* Every struct should be allocated/stored as a pointer to match Haxe by-refs behavior
